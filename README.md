Fixed some issues at Roam Reasearch that were annoying to me

* Changed the font stack
* Made bullets bigger, spacier
* Aligned them to the line (But only for the default text size, the other heading sizes are hopeless)
* Made the spacing between blocks a little more comfortable 
* Cleaned up the vertical lines
* Fixed some jumpiness due to font-size changes on hover. (Please quit that shit, Roam.)
